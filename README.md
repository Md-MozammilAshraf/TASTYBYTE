## Field Work Review
MAYA, a recent graduate, moves to the city for her new job. She settles into a paying guest accommodation, excited but also daunted by the fast-paced lifestyle. One day, while scrolling through her social media feed, she comes across an ad for TastyBite.com. Intrigued by the promise of convenient, affordable meals tailored for individuals like her living in shared accommodations, Maya decides to explore further.
Curious, Maya visits the TastyBite.com website. As she navigates through the menu options and subscription plans, she realizes the potential of having delicious, chef-prepared meals delivered to her doorstep without the hassle of grocery shopping and cooking. The affordability and variety of cuisines offered catch her attention, especially considering her tight budget and limited cooking facilities in the shared kitchen of her accommodation.
Maya deliberates over her dining options, weighing the benefits of subscribing to TastyBite.com against her current routine of quick, often unsatisfying meals cooked hastily in the communal kitchen. She reads reviews from fellow residents who praise the convenience and quality of TastyBite.com's meals, ultimately swaying her decision. Maya decides to take the plunge and subscribe to TastyBite.com's annual plan, eager to simplify her dining experience and savor delicious meals without breaking the bank.
